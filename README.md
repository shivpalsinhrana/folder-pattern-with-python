# folder-pattern-with-python

This is a small program used to create multiple folders (or folder pattern) using python. 

For ex. one can create folders like Section 1, Section 2.... etc.

Motivation: Whenever i start a new online course, i organize the contents/syllabus according to the weeks or sections in the course. So, if there are 15 sections, i have to make many folders one after another. This piece of code will let you create such folders in one go.

Double clicking or running the code, your are prompted to type first part or title of the folder.

Then you have to type the starting number and ending number of the folders you wish to create.

Afterwards type y if you want to continue.

I am currently working on making a proper user interface using TKinter

Please feel free to improve the code!
